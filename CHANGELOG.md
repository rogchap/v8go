## [v0.10.0] - 2023-04-10

### Changed
- Required Go version changed to 1.17 (needed for SharedArrayBuffer support)

### Added
- Support for getting the underlying data (as a `[]byte`) from a SharedArrayBuffer

### Fixed
- Upgrade to V8 11.1.277.13


## [v0.9.0] - 2023-03-30

### Fixed
- Upgrade to V8 11.1.277.13

## [v0.8.0] - 2023-01-19

### Added
- Added support for Value.release() and FunctionCallbackInfo.release(). This is useful when using v8go in a long-running context.

### Fixed
- Use string length to ensure null character-containing strings in Go/JS are not terminated early.
- Object.Set with an empty key string is now supported
- Upgrade to V8 10.9.194.9
- Upgrade V8 build OS to Ubuntu 22.04

## [v0.7.0] - 2021-12-09

### Added
- Support for calling constructors functions with NewInstance on Function
- Access "this" from function callback
- value.SameValue(otherValue) function to compare values for sameness
- Undefined, Null functions to get these constant values for the isolate
- Support for calling a method on an object.
- Support for calling `IsExecutionTerminating` on isolate to check if execution is still terminating.
- Support for setting and getting internal fields for template object instances
- Support for CPU profiling
- Add V8 build for Apple Silicon
- Add support for throwing an exception directly via the isolate's ThrowException function.
- Support for compiling a context-dependent UnboundScript which can be run in any context of the isolate it was compiled in.
- Support for creating a code cache from an UnboundScript which can be used to create an UnboundScript in other isolates
to run a pre-compiled script in new contexts.
- Included compile error location in `%+v` formatting of JSError
- Enable i18n support

### Changed
- Removed error return value from NewIsolate which never fails
- Removed error return value from NewContext which never fails
- Removed error return value from Context.Isolate() which never fails
- Removed error return value from NewObjectTemplate and NewFunctionTemplate. Panic if given a nil argument.
- Function Call accepts receiver as first argument. This **subtle breaking change** will compile old code but interpret the first argument as the receiver. Use `Undefined` to prepend an argument to fix old Call use.
- Removed Windows support until its build issues are addressed.
- Upgrade to V8 9.6.180.12

### Fixed
- Add some missing error propagation
- Fix crash from template finalizer releasing V8 data, let it be disposed with the isolate
- Fix crash by keeping alive the template while its C++ pointer is still being used
- Fix crash from accessing function template callbacks outside of `RunScript`, such as in `JSONStringify`

## [v0.6.0] - 2021-05-11

### Changed
- Upgrade to V8 9.0.257.18

### Fixed
- Go GC attempting to free C memory (via finalizer) of values after an Isolate is disposed causes a panic

### Changed
- NewContext() API has been improved to handle optional global object, as well as optional Isolate
- Package error messages are now prefixed with `v8go` rather than the struct name
- Deprecated `iso.Close()` in favor of `iso.Dispose()` to keep consistancy with the C++ API
